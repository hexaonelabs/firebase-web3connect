## Getting Started

Firebase Web3Connect is designed to be easy to integrate into your Firebase project.
Simply create or use an existing Firebase project, configure Firebase Web3Connect with your Firebase project settings using Authentication Service, and start using Firebase Web3Connect to authenticate users with Web3 wallets.

### **Prerequisites:**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Firebase project with Firebase Authentication enabled.
- Setup desired sign-in methods in Firebase Authentication settings.
- A application or DApp that you want to integrate with Firebase Authentication.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Firebase.

### **1. Installation:**

Install Firebase Web3Connect in your project using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install @hexaonelabs/firebase-web3connect
# or
yarn add @hexaonelabs/firebase-web3connect
```

### **2. Configuration:**

Configure Firebase Web3Connect with your Firebase project settings.

```javascript
import { FirebaseOptions, initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

// Import FirebaseWeb3Connect from the package
import { FirebaseWeb3Connect, SigninMethod } from '@hexaonelabs/firebase-web3connect';

const firebaseConfig: FirebaseOptions = {
  // Your Firebase configuration here
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
// Initialize Firebase Auth
const auth = getAuth(app);

// create local instance of FirebaseWeb3Connect
const firebaseWeb3Connect = new FirebaseWeb3Connect(auth, APIKEY);
// now you can use `firebaseWeb3Connect` to connect and manage users with Web3 wallets

```

### **3. Usage:**

Start using Firebase Web3Connect in your application to authenticate users with Web3 wallets.

```javascript
// Connect user with Web3 wallet using Firebase Authentication
const connect = async () => {
	const userInfo = await firebaseWeb3Connect.connectWithUI();
	// userInfo contains user information
	return userInfo;
};

const signOut = async () => {
	await firebaseWeb3Connect.signOut();
};
```

```javascript
// Listen user connnection state change with `.onConnectStateChanged()` callback
firebaseWeb3Connect.onConnectStateChanged(async user => {
	if (user) {
		// user is connected with web3 wallet + firebase
	} else {
		// user is not connected
	}
});
```

### **4. Documentation:**

For detailed documentation and API reference, please refer to the [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).
